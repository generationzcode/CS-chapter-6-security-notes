## Definitions:
*  Assymetric encryption - An encryption system where the key is kept secret by one side of the communication
*  Biometric check - A security check relying on checking one or more of your physical features such as fingerprints
*  Cypher text - Text which has been hidden using encryption. Cypher text can only be read by a computer which knows the encryption key
*  Decryption - Turning cypher text into plain text which is readable
*  Denial of sevice - An attack on a computer overloading it with messages and queries so it stops working.
*  Encryption key - A hidden number value which the computer can use to decrypt text
*  Firewall - a combination of software and hardware which screens the data coming in and out of the system
*  Identitiy theft - pretending to be another person online
*  Malpractice - Making mistakes while using a computer system. Can result in loss of data or loss of privacy
*  Pharming - Making a fake website to trick people into sending you their identity details
*  Phishing - sending fake emails to trick people into sending you their identity details
*  Symmetric encryption - an encryption system where the encryption key is knonwn by both sides of the communication
## Accidental Damage And Malicious Actions On Data
### Data loss
*  Data can be lost by mislaying the data storage device or accidentally deleting it
*  This can severely affect bussinesses. For example the data loss of a database of customers bank details would mean the company will not be able to get money from its consumers
### Data corruption
*  Data corruption is when the data is damaged or changed.
*  Changes to the data can be changing the file format to a wrong format or causing the data to be innacurate
*  Damage to data like in the case of scratching a CD-R can lead to corruption of that data
*  If data is severely damaged it doesnt make sense anynmore at all and cant be read.
### Unauthorised access to data
*  Privacy means data can only be read from or copied by those who have permission.
*  Unauthorised access is when someone without permission copies or reads that data. 
*  An example would be someone copying user's login credentials from a database without permission to do so
### Unauthorised changing of data
*  Integrity of data refers to the data being protected from unauthorised changes
*  Someone doing this would be "hacking"
*  Doing this would be a threat to the data integrity
*  some people might want to do this to increase the amount of money in their bank accounts
